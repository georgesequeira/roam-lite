# roam-lite

The goal here is to use clojurescript and whatever else i need to build a roam lite clone. I think just having an editor without saving is a good starting spot but we shall see.

This is going to be written in clojurescript. The tools that we are going to use for simplicity:

* clojure
* shadow-cljs
* clojurescript

We also installed calva as a extension of VSCode to allow for an interactie repl.

## Installing Clojure
`brew install clojure/tools/clojure`
had to update my system to have the new dev tools.

## Using Clojure on it's own.
